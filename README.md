Source code
-----------
The project is written in Java. 
Java 25 is used for development, but Java 8+ should be fine for using this API.

Directory Structure

Extremely simple:
- `bin/` -- 
   Contains all of the bytecode of API
- `src/` --
   Contains all of the source code of API
- `test/` --
   Contains the pre-written code showing example and usage

To-do list
----------
- Boundify the main rendering recursion OR turn it into a loop maybe
- Improve code explainations and custom conventions
- Proper API documentation
- Fix some weird floating point quirks 
- Continue building the API with the rest of the guide
- Multithreading??
